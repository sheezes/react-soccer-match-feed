    { minute: 1, type: 'update', content: `We are underway in the first half at Estadio Santiago Bernabeu! It's El Clasico and it could define the LaLiga title race. Don't miss anything, this should be a cracker.` },
    { minute: 3, type: 'update', content: `Shout for a penalty! Ramos opens play out to the right-hand side for Carvajal to chase, with the right-back immediately trying to hook a volley back square into the box. Ronaldo gets to it first and skips beyond Umtiti before going down. There was contact and that should have been given.` },
    { minute: 4, type: 'update', content: `Real Madrid are dominating in the early stages and enjoying all of the ball. Carvajal plays a one-two with Ronaldo before darting to the byline, but a clipped cross from the right isn't met by anybody in a white shirt at the back post.` },
    { minute: 6, type: 'update', content: `Benzema releases Ronaldo in behind down the right-hand side, with the Portugal international streaking forward at real pace. He chops inside Pique brilliantly, before trying his luck with a left-footed effort from the edge of the box. His shot is gobbled up quite simply by Ter Stegen.` },
    { minute: 8, type: 'update', content: `The hosts' front three have been very fluid so far, with their pacey, high-tempo approach to the opening stages looking to unsettle Barcelona. Jordi Alba finds Suarez on the edge of the area, with Casemiro bringing down the visiting forward, but the referee once again plays on. It appeared that the Brazilian midfield got a good foot to the ball in the process.` },
    { minute: 10, type: 'update', content: `Carvajal lifts a pass up to Ronaldo, who chests a neat pass down to Benzema. Real Madrid's front three keep rotating and replacing one another in different spaces, with it clear that Zidane is keen to try and test the visiting full-backs. Luis Enrique's men have only had a couple of meaningful passages of play, with Iniesta most recently seeing a shot blocked.` },
    { minute: 11, type: 'update', content: `Wide from Suarez! Messi manages to move the ball out wide to the left-hand side, with Jordi Alba invited forward. The ex-Valencia defender cuts back a brilliant pass to Suarez on the edge of the box, but a rushed shot from the Uruguay international flashes beyond the far post.` },

    { minute: 14, type: 'update', content: `The opening quarter of an hour has swung back and forth, with both teams showing a little bit of what they will be trying to do this evening. Bale makes a mistake inside his own box, but isn't penalised for it, before the Welshman is then caught offside while trying to get in behind Jordi Alba.` },
    { minute: 16, type: 'update', content: `Pique tries to lift a long ball over the top for Alcacer to chase, but the pass skips straight through to Navas.
